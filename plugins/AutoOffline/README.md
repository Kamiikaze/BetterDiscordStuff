# AutoOffline - BetterDiscord Plugin
Automatically sets your Discord status to online when the app starts, and to invisible when the app quits.

## Motivation
When you briefly open Discord on your phone to check messages—then close it—your status remains online for a while, even though you’re gone. This can lead to unwanted pings or messages.
AutoOffline solves this by immediately switching you back to invisible as soon as the app closes, so your friends always see your true availability.

- Online on launch

- Invisible on quit

## Installation
Download [AutoOffline.plugin.js](https://github.com/Kamiikaze/BetterDiscordStuff/blob/master/plugins/AutoOffline/AutoOffline.plugin.js) into your BetterDiscord plugins folder.

In Discord, go to `User Settings → BetterDiscord → Plugins`, and enable AutoOffline.

## Usage
No configuration needed.

Status changes happen automatically at app start and quit.

Toast notifications confirm each status update.


## ToDo
- [ ] Add configuration
  - [ ] status to set when starting/closing app
